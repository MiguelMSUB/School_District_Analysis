# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
In this project we helped the School Board to analyze data on student funding and students' standarized test scores. This analysis will assist in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. 

The school board has notified that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. So the school board want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to us for help. We've been asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once we’ve replaced the math and reading scores, we repeated the school district analysis that we did the first time and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results:
